## Investigation Timeline

Recommendation: examine transparency data around these key periods:

**February 1, 2026:**
- **9:00-12:00**: Morning budget workshop (expect moderate organic activity)
- **18:00-21:00**: Evening budget hearing (expect major organic activity)
- **21:00-23:00**: Post-hearing discussion period

**February 2, 2026:**
- **12:00-15:00**: Candidate meet & greet (expect light activity)
- **17:00-20:00**: Candidate forum (expect major organic activity)  
- **20:00-22:00**: Post-forum discussion period

**February 3, 2026:**
- **07:00-09:00**: Morning planning meeting period
- **19:00-21:00**: Final hours before zoning comment deadline
- **20:00**: Exact deadline moment (watch for coordination spikes)

## Expected Organic Patterns

**Natural civic engagement should show:**
- Gradual activity buildup before major events
- Peak activity during and immediately after events
- Diverse hash cluster engagement
- Mixed account age participation
- Primarily manual posting with some scheduled civic announcements

**Suspicious coordination would show:**
- Sudden synchronized spikes unrelated to event timing
- Artificial amplification of specific hash clusters
- New account surges during key moments
- High API automation during civic discussions
- Cross-hash coordination that doesn't follow natural topic relationships

## Platform Simulation Details

**Single Platform Focus:**  
This transparency data represents one social media platform's civic discourse monitoring. In reality, coordination often spans multiple platforms, but this simulation focuses on patterns detectable within a single platform's transparency API.

**Data Granularity:**  
- 1-minute interval aggregation
- Privacy-preserving hash-based topic identification
- Behavioral signals only (no content access)
- k-anonymity protection (minimum 100 posts per reported interval)

Analyze whether the behavioral patterns around these civic events represent organic community engagement or coordinated manipulation efforts.
