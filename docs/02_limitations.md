# Limitations

## Do These APIs Exist?

**Currently:** 
- Platforms share limited data (Twitter/X Academic API, Meta CrowdTangle)
- Mostly post-hoc, researcher-only access
- Not real-time, not this comprehensive

**This exercise:**
- Models what *could* exist with better transparency
- Uses synthetic data generated to match real behavioral patterns
- Demonstrates analysis techniques applicable to real data

## What This Approach Might Miss

**Sophisticated evasion:**
- Slow-drip campaigns over weeks (low burst scores)
- Human-assisted coordination (not API-based)
- Authentic grassroots with digital coordination tools

**False positives:**
- Breaking news events (legitimate spikes)
- Activist campaigns (coordinated but authentic)
- Cultural posting patterns (synchronous by habit, not coordination)

**Detection requires:**
- Multiple signal convergence
- Context understanding
- Human judgment for edge cases
