# Prior Work: Hash Cluster Analysis Context

## Hash Values Are NOT Content Aware

Hash values are not content aware, however we can simulate a bit of analyst pre-processing to facilitate conversation. 

### Privacy-Preserving Structure:

- Hashes are the primary identifiers (a7f3d9e2, b8e4c1f5, etc.)
- Labels are explicitly "suggested" and "guessed"
- Confidence levels acknowledge uncertainty
- Usage guidelines emphasize hash-based analysis

### Benefits

- Pre-mapping enables discussion of "the budget-related hash" instead of "hash a7f3d9e2"
- Makes conversation more natural while maintaining privacy framework
- Shows how analysts work with limited information
- Demonstrates uncertainty in real-world analysis

### Analysis Integrity

- All queries use hashes
- Labels don't appear in database tables
- Analysis conclusions must be behavioral, not content-based
- Maintains the civic transparency specification
  
## Possible Mapping of Hashes to Real-World Topics

Based on temporal correlation with the [civic event calendar](./06_calendar_scope.md), analysts suggest that each topic (content hash) **may** be mapped to events as follows: 

**Expected High-Activity Hash Clusters:**
- `hash_a7f3d9e2`: Likely budget-related discussions (correlates with Feb 1 events)
- `hash_b8e4c1f5`: Likely school board election content (correlates with Feb 2 events)  
- `hash_c9f6a3d8`: Likely zoning proposal discussions (correlates with Feb 3 deadline)

**Expected Moderate-Activity Hash Clusters:**
- `hash_d4e7f2a1`: Municipal services discussions
- `hash_e8b3c6f9`: Local transportation/transit topics
- `hash_f1a5d8e2`: Housing and development issues

**Expected Lower-Activity Hash Clusters:**
- `hash_g7c2f9b4`: Parks and recreation
- `hash_h3d6a4e8`: Environmental/climate discussions  
- `hash_i9f8e1c7`: Public safety topics
- `hash_j2a9f5d3`: Infrastructure and utilities
- `hash_k6e4b7f1`: Community events and culture
- `hash_l8c1d9a6`: Municipal elections (general)
- `hash_m4f7e3b8`: Downtown revitalization
- `hash_n1d5a8f2`: Bike infrastructure
- `hash_o7b9e4c1`: Community center projects
